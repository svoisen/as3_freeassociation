AS3 Free Association
====================

Overview
--------

This library provides an easy way (in ActionScript) to access and explore the data found in the University of South Florida Free Association Norms database. This database comprises the largest collection of free association data ever collected in the United States -- over three-quarters of a million responses to 5,019 stimulus words.

Free association databases such as this may prove to be interesting resources worth exploring not only for psychologists, but also for linguists and artificial intelligence researchers.  For instance, the AS3 Free Association library allows users to quickly find semantic connective paths between words and concepts. An example query might involve finding the shortest cue to target semantic path between such disparate concepts as "MUSIC" and "DOG" (MUSIC -> PRETTY -> HOT -> DOG).
